### Introduction ###

>"Interval House is Canadaâ€™s first center for women survivors of intimate partner violence and their children.
Founded in 1973 by a feminist collective, we have always had a pioneering spirit, taking a holistic approach to helping
women and children leave abuse behind and start new lives, free of violence."   

_- [Interval House, 2021](https://www.intervalhouse.ca/inside-interval-house/)_

As an ally in the fight against partner violence Interval House has helped improve the lives of many women, and children
over its years of operation. During its deployment, Interval House has also increased its capacity to help; both in
terms of size, as well as pioneering different services that can better help individuals escaping violence.

Data analytics are yet another area that Interval House would like to explore in its constant push to better help its clients.

This project follows an explorative analysis of Interval House data in an attempt to identify, and better serve
areas of need in their present/future client list.

_*This project is explorative and informal in nature; this repository will help track research and discoveries from pertinent datasets._
