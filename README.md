### Introduction ###
    "Interval House is Canadaâ€™s first center for women survivors of intimate partner violence and their children.
Founded in 1973 by a feminist collective, we have always had a pioneering spirit, taking a holistic approach to helping
women and children leave abuse behind and start new lives, free of violence."   - [Interval House](https://www.intervalhouse.ca/inside-interval-house/)
